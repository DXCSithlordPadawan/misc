MATLAB Deployment Documentation Prompt

Goal:
Create a complete documentation with details and configuration package for installing the latest release of MatLab on a RHEL Redhat 9.x environment with internal database, LDAP/LDAPS SSO, and mutual TLS, aligned with UK Government Secure by Design (SByD), NCSC guidelines, DISA Stig guidlines, FIPS 140-3 Guidlines, and CIS Benchmark Level 2.

Requirements:
1. Environment Details:
   - Air-gapped Redhat Enterprise Server 9.X vitual machine
   - MATLAB installed as standalone server
   - Authentication: LDAP integration with Active Directory (username/password over LDAPS)
   - Certificates: Issued by AD Certificate Services, mutual TLS required
   - VM domain-joined before installation
   - Default firewall configuration

2. Compliance:
   - UK Gov Secure by Design
   - NCSC Secure Design Principles
   - CIS Benchmark Level 2 for Linux
   - Disa Stig for RHEL 9
   - Fips 140-3

3. Deliverables:
   - architecture.md (Mermaid diagrams for architecture, architecture details,network, certificate trust chain)
   - database.md (Mermaid diagrams for database architecture, architecture details,network, tables and relationships)
   - security.md (Threat model details, CIS L2 hardening steps, TLS config, RBAC mapping, compliance table)
   - installation.md (Pre-requisite details, database setup steps, MATLAB installation steps, HTTPS+mTLS implementation, LDAP config steps)
   - YAML configuration files: matlab-config.yaml, matlab-security.yaml
   - README.md (TOC, usage instructions, embedded diagrams, YAML examples)
   - Comprehensive PDF guide (Executive Summary, Compliance Checklist, all docs, diagrams, YAML examples)
   - PowerPoint (.pptx) for stakeholders

4. Formatting:
   - All documents in Markdown (.md)
   - Diagrams in Mermaid syntax
   - Config files in YAML
   - Bundle everything into a ZIP
   - Include PDF and PPTX versions for distribution

Additional Features:
- Executive Summary and Compliance Checklist in PDF
- README with clickable Table of Contents
- Embedded diagrams and YAML examples in README
- PowerPoint for stakeholder presentation

Output Structure:
- architecture.md
- database.md
- security.md
- installation.md
- matlab-config.yaml
- matlab-security.yaml
- README.md
- MATLAB_Deployment_Guide.pdf
- MATLAB_Deployment_Overview.pptx
